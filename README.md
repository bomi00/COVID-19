# COVID-19
This is a predictions of the people who have recovered from COVID-19 by August 1, 2020

This is how I worked it step by step 

1. First, I did research on covid-19. I research what is it, who and how people get affected. I also search for the statistics on it like the confirmed, death, and recovery rate. 
2. Looking at all the information I decided that my question should be “What would be the amount of people who recovered from covid-19 by august 1st, 2020”
3. Shortly after coming up with my question I found the dataset I would be analysing. 
4. After looking at the data, I decided to download it and use it for my project
5. I imported pandas and numpy because I need those 2 libraries to analyze the data
6. Then I took the data I got off online and imported it in the Jupyter Notebook with the pandas library
7. Next I started to clear the data because some of the data was unnecessary to answer my question
8. At the first I didn’t know where to start because they summarized the data by give the first 5 rows and the last five rows
9. Then I used a built-in function ‘iloc’ this help sort through the data and see where the data started exactly 
10. After figuring it out I started to delete the columns
11. Next I used the histogram function to describe each column and what they were doing
12. Then I found the mean of each day and put it in a dataframe variable 
13. After, I put the colunms of each day in a seperate dataframe variable. 
14. When I plot it the first time there were too many data points to see what was going on 
15. So i used the 'iloc' function so I could skip some data points to get the full picture
16. I only did that on the x axis so but not the y so it raised an error because both x and y are suppose to thace the same amount of data points in order to graph
17. Next I changed the y axis and put it as the same amount as the as the x axis 
18. Finally but graph plotted it points
